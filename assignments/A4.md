## Assignment 4 Bias Mitigation
### 1. Complete the preprocessing algorithm

- Complete the Reweighing function in [preprocessor.py](src/preprocessor.py).

  
### 1.5 Test your code with [test/test_A4.py](test/test_A4.py).
- Get to assignments/
```
(tf2_gpu_env) YOUR-PATH/IDAI-720/assignments$ python -m unittest test.test_A4 -v
```
- See if the test passes.

### 2. Retrain the VGG-16 model with the sample weights calculated by Reweighing
- Execute [A4.py](src/A4.py) file.
- Take a screenshot of the execution result (last 10 lines at least).
- Save the screenshot as _/screenshots/A4.png_.
- See if the group fairness metrics have been improved by Reweighing.
- Remember to push your code.

## Rubric
- 2 points if the screenshot exists.
- 2 points if the reported metrics are different from those of A3.
- 2 points if the implementation of Reweighing is correct.
