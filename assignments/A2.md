## Assignment 2 Active Learning
### 0. Complete the active learning code

- Complete the active_query() function in [src/vgg_pre.py](src/vgg_pre.py#L131C9-L131C21).
- This function should take inputs from the [pool.csv](data/pool.csv) file and output the top K most uncertain ones with the current model.
  
### 0.5 Test your code with [test/test_A2.py](test/test_A2.py).
- Get to assignments/
```
(tf2_gpu_env) YOUR-PATH/IDAI-720/assignments$ python -m unittest test.test_A2 -v
```
- See if the tests pass.

### 1. Annotate more data with active learning
- Execute [A2_query.py](src/A2_query.py) file to move 10 unlabeled data points from pool.csv to train.csv.
- Annotate the additional 10 data points from train.csv in the same way as Assignment 1.

### 2. Update the VGG-16 model with the newly labeled data
- Execute [A2_train.py](src/A2_train.py) file.
- Take a screenshot of the execution result (last 10 lines at least).
- Save the screenshot as _/screenshots/A2_ID.png_ where ID is the index of the repeats.

### Repeat Step 1 and 2 at least 5 times

- Remember to push your code.

## Rubric
- 2 points if the screenshots (at least 5 of them) exist.
- 2 points if the test accuracy from the last screenshot is higher than that of A1.
- 2 points if the implementation of uncertainty sampling is correct (all unit tests pass).
